# Analyse FBI aggregate crime data for closest matches to MA data

Our original data analysis work was done with a dataset of PA crimes, calculating the Euclidian distance between matrices of crime rates for MA and other states. This folder contains an attempt to revisit that work, calculating the distance between MA and other states crime rates with both standardized and non-standardized variables.
