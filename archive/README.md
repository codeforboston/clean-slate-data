# Analyses

Current (Fall 2020) use of this folder lumps all steps of data processing and analysis into the [notebooks](notebooks) folder. All others are legacy folders from prior work looking to proxy MA using PA or other state data.

Some outputs are stored in Drive, eg: [tables and figures](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Cka95eaHG_n9tTzy39w27MSdEcTVoCFz)

_Prior description of this folder:_

Did you do something with the data? Develop sicknasty graphs that will knock legislators off their heels? Build models that will change juvenile criminal justice in Massachusetts from now till forever?

This is where that lives! All the code of your analyses and outputs should exist nested in here.

If your code spans multiple files, creates outputs, or is just super impressive, feel free to make a subfolder in this directory and add it to the list below! Remember to include a readme in your folder explaining what your code does!

Otherwise, feel free to throw self-contained analysis units in the [notebooks](notebooks) folder and document them there.

|File / Folder|Description|
|---|---|
|[data-expungement](data-expungement)|Contains the initial analysis that we used to determine PA was the best proxy for MA crime, using 2014 FBI data.|
|[determine_closest_state_2018_fbi](determine_closest_state_2018_fbi) and [determine_closest_state_2014_2018_fbi](determine_closest_state_fb_2014_2018)|Two parallel analyses, looking to leverage aggregate FBI arrest records to determine appropriate proxies for MA crime rates.|
|[notebooks](notebooks)|Holds all single file projects that don't need their own folder.|
