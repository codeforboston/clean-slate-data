# Clean Slate

_Expungement with Citizens for Juvenile Justice, Code for Boston, and legal aid services._

**Expungement:** "Having a criminal record expunged means that the record will be permanently destroyed so that it's no longer accessible by the court or any other state, municipal, or county agencies." - https://www.mass.gov/expunge-your-criminal-record

_Note: Expungement is different than sealing_

## What’s Wrong

If you ever got convicted of a crime or arraigned, even if it turns out someone made a mistake, you’ll have a criminal record. Anyone that does a background check, like an employer, sees that you have a criminal record and that’s the end of it. You lose out.

**Even something false or small can stop you from getting honest work, housing, education, and other opportunities.**

Massachusetts expungement laws were created in October of 2018, but almost no one can qualify and applying is hard. Sometimes it’s even a bad idea to expunge your records and people don’t know.

[Citizens For Juvenile Justice](https://www.cfjj.org/) is working with [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) (a civic tech volunteer organization) and legal aid services in the Boston area to tackle this problem on a project called Clean Slate.

## Who We Need

We need members of the community, legal professionals, community advocates, project managers, designers, technologists, and people passionate about criminal justice reform to help us understand what’s wrong with what we have and to try to make it better.
