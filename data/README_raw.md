# Raw datasets (and scripts to retrieve them as applicable)

This folder contains all non-sensitive raw datasets obtained for this project.

When adding data, please add your dataset to this readme with a quick blurb listing:
- its source (original source location and retrieval method)
- extent (temporal/other windowing factors, size of the dataset, and if it's a sample, how large of a sample it is and how samples were chosen)
- any non-obvious variables (to newcomers to the dataset)
- and uses so far!

## Data on Google Drive or elsewhere

Several datasets on Google Drive are crucial for identifying which offenses are potentially eligible for expungement. These are in [Drive\Clean Slate\Data Analysis](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/16C65KqyzTnendr0-4uZahz1RgSnzWmr-)

## Manual data correction sheets -- on Drive

After the join between Suffolk county, NW, and the Master Crime List with Expunge categories, many offenses were still missing expungeability information. This was filled in manually using several different sheets. These are in [Drive\Clean Slate\Data Analysis\MA Expungement Analysis\data cleaning](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1xD_8ijcmvH8QKM7bdVKfVJaGHArqtfj3) and the archive.
