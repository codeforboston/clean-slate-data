# Clean Slate

_Expungement with Citizens for Juvenile Justice, Code for Boston, and legal aid services._

**Expungement:** "Having a criminal record expunged means that the record will be permanently destroyed so that it's no longer accessible by the court or any other state, municipal, or county agencies." - https://www.mass.gov/expunge-your-criminal-record

_Note: Expungement is different than sealing_

## What’s Wrong

Our criminal record system is broken. If you ever got convicted of a crime or arraigned (brought to court for a criminal charge), even if it turns out someone made a mistake, you’ll have a criminal record. **Even something false or small can stop you from getting honest work, housing, education, and other opportunities.** It will show up on background checks when applying for jobs, housing, schools, loans and much more. You can find more information from [Find out if you can expunge your criminal record](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/find-out-if-you-can-expunge-your-criminal-record#who-can-expunge-their-record?-)

Massachusetts expungement laws were created in October of 2018, but almost no one can qualify and applying is hard. Sometimes it’s even a bad idea to expunge your records and people don’t know.
**[Citizens For Juvenile Justice](https://www.cfjj.org/) (CFJJ)** is working with [Code for Boston](https://www.codeforboston.org/) (a civic tech volunteer organization) and legal aid services in the Boston area to tackle this problem on a project called Clean Slate.

### Our google doc [Clean Slate Project Overview]("https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RgdgMR6-YVQt7zPbDtKI090_BOEG14Y2LO-jClBC1Kk/edit") is another resource where we document the project. The contents are slated to be added to the github wiki.

# Goal

### High Level

Our goal is to help folks help make criminal record expungement more accessible to make it possible for those who deserve it. We are tackling this problem from two fronts. Our data team is working with existing court and criminal data to find out what factors are preventing people from expunging their record so we can optimize our policies. Our App team is working on a web app so that people can apply to get their records expunged online.

1. Make it easier for folks to apply for expungement.
2. Show what parts of the law are stopping most people from expunging their records.
3. Digitally organize to advocate for changes to the law.

### Questions to Answer

We are working with Cititzens for Juvenile Justice (CFJJ) and we're helping to answer the following questions and specifically for those with criminal charges under 21 (for all questions - only concerned with those under 21).

1. **Find how many individuals are eligible for expungement under our current policies.** Expungement is possible only for those with only one charge AND the charge must not be part of the list of ineligible offenses
2. Number of individuals that would be eligible for expungment if there was only one incident (but may have multiple offenses/charges within this incident) with none of the offenses on the list of ineligible offenses

3. How many would be eligible for expungement if all offenses/charges are eligible for expungement except those related to sex or murder. How many would be eligible if we compare allowing only one charge vs multiple charges

4. How many would be eligible if only those found to be guilty and charges were on list of ineligible offenses were excluded from eligibility. How many would be eligible if we compare allowing only one charge vs multiple charges.
5. How many would be eligible only those found to be guilty and charges were related to sex or murder were excluded from eligibility. How many would be eligible if we compare allowing only one charge vs multiple charges.

Initial questions from CFJJ can be found in our github issues at [Questions for CFJJ for MA Prosecution Dataset](https://github.com/codeforboston/clean-slate/issues/152)
